# P3 (6% of grade): MongoDB

Github Classroom Link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/9QLZxrY7](https://classroom.github.com/a/9QLZxrY7) (group assignment)

## :telescope: Overview

In this project, you'll perform basic and advanced analysis of the `sample_mflix` database using MongoDB Query Language (MQL).

Learning objectives:
* Set up MongoDB using Docker on your Google VM.
* Explore basic NoSQL database operations operations using MongoDB Query Language (MQL).
* Write and execute MQL queries to extract meaningful insights on `sample_mflix` dataset.

Before starting, please review the [general project directions](../projects.md).

:warning: You will be answering 34 questions. **We recommend getting started early with the project.**

:warning: Please use Piazza to post (public/private) any questions regarding this project, as e-mails will NOT be answered. If you need to include your code to get help, please make a **private** post.

## :pushpin: Corrections/Clarifications

1. **[Oct 09, 2024]** Fixed official solutions for `Q25` and `Q30`. This should be automatically reflected in autograding (that is, if you had a correct solution but were getting marked `FAILED`, this should fix it).
2. **[Oct 14, 2024]** Added clarifications for `Q6` and `Q16`. This will not affect any correct submissions.
3. **[Oct 15, 2024]** Added clarifications for `Q25` and `Q30`. This will not affect any correct submissions.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setting up MongoDB using Docker

- In your VM, pull the official MongoDB Docker image:

```bash
docker pull mongo
```
**Note:** If you are still using `sudo` to run `docker` commands, please follow the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) (don't go beyond the "Manage Docker as a non-root user" section).

- Create and run a MongoDB container using the following command:

```bash
docker run --name <container-name> -d -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017 mongo
```

- Verify MongoDB is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

## :nut_and_bolt: Setting up `jupyter`, `pymongo`, and other libraries

- If you haven't already installed these packages on your VM, make sure to complete the below installations:

```bash
pip3 install jupyter pandas nbformat nbconvert
```

- Now, install `pymongo` so we can interact with MongoDB via Python.

```bash
pip3 install pymongo
```

- In addition, install `geopandas` and `matplotlib`--we'll ue the two to interact with and visualize GeoJSON data.

```bash
pip3 install geopandas matplotlib
```

- Create a new directory to keep track of your p3 files and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir p3
cd p3/
```

- Then, launch `jupyter` using the below command, and make note of the auto-generated URL.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

- To access the `jupyter` session on your laptop, you must establish an `ssh` tunnel. Open a new terminal or powershell tab, then use either of the below commands to establish your tunnel.

```bash
ssh <USER>@IP -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888
```
or
```bash
gcloud compute ssh <VM_NAME> -- -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888
```

:point_right: Double-check that the second port matches the port in the URL.

:point_right: If port 8888 is occupied on your laptop, you can change the first port (source port) in the above command to a different port number.

- Now, open the jupyter URL in your browser, and create a new notebook file (File > New > Notebook). Make sure to save it as `p3.ipynb`.

## :floppy_disk: Writing code in `p3.ipynb` to set up ```sample_mflix``` database 

1. Inside your notebook, use the appropriate `bash` command to unzip the ```sample_mflixz.zip``` dataset file. **Note:** During the lecture, we covered how to run bash command from inside notebook file. If required, please review lecture demo code.

### Loading ```sample_mflix``` database

1. In a new cell, make sure to type in the necessary `import` statements.
2. Following that, create a new cell to establish connection to your `mongodb` server using `MongoClient` from the `pymongo` module.
3. Then load the content of each `JSON` file into the database.
   * Your database table name must match with each `JSON` file name (including the case).
   * There is an efficient way to load all the `JSON` files without having to type each `JSON` file's name.
      * If you are not familiar with the `os` module `listdir` function, please look it up.
      * You can use a combination of string methods and the `os` module to load all `JSON` files without having to type individual files names. 
   * Please use `bson.json_util.loads()` to load the JSON files (and NOT the `json` module).

## :blue_book: Section 1: Basic MQL operations (20 questions)
:point_right: Each question in this section is worth 0.1 points.

:warning: **Requirements (applies to all subsequent questions)**:
- Each solution cell should be marked using the appropriate question number as a comment. For example, at the beginning of the cell answering question 1, you should have this comment: "#q1".

- Each question's resultant data must be stored into a file called `q<N>.pkl`, where `N` refers to the question number. Save all the files in a folder called `answers/`. For example, store q1's results using the below code:

```
q1 = list(db.movies.find ...)
with open('answers/q1.pkl', 'wb') as f:
   pickle.dump(q1, f)
```

- Please ensure that your output is saved in a `list`, `dict` or `numeric` format (as appropriate); that is, do not save `PyCursor` objects.

- Make sure to go back to the cell containing import statements and include `import pickle` (and other necessary libraries, as needed).

- For each question, unless explicitly stated, you should output all fields of the collection(s) you're working with. For example, if you're asked to find the first movie released in year 2021, you should display all data/fields for that movie in the `movies` collection, and not just the title.

For your personal verification, you can display the output of the your queries.

## :closed_book: Section 4: GeoJSON (3 questions)
:point_right: Each question in this section is worth 0.4 points.

:point_right: The autograder for this section only checks for existence of image file(s). We will manually review the images and assign grades.

:warning: **Requirements (applies to all subsequent questions)**:
- Your output should only be an image/plot.
- Please save the image in the same folder as your notebook, and label it `q<N>.png`, where `N` refers to the question number.
- You can use the below function to create the plots.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from shapely.geometry import Point

# Function to plot theaters on a map
def plot_theaters(theaters, map_type, filename):
    assert map_type in ['wi', 'madison']
    assert filename in ['q32', 'q33', 'q34']
    
    # Convert theater coordinates to a GeoDataFrame
    gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(theaters, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(
        [theater['location']['geo']['coordinates'][0] for theater in theaters],
        [theater['location']['geo']['coordinates'][1] for theater in theaters]
    ))

    world = gpd.read_file("wi_limits.geojson")
    if map_type == 'madison':
        world = gpd.read_file("madison_limits.geojson")
    gdf = gdf.set_crs(world.crs)
    
    # Plot
    ax = world.plot(figsize=(10, 6), color='lightgray', edgecolor='black')
    gdf.plot(ax=ax, marker='o', color='red', markersize=5)
    plt.title("Theater Locations")

    plt.grid(True)
    plt.savefig(f'{filename}.png')
    plt.show()
```

- You're provided with two GeoJSON files: [Madison city limits](https://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/db89adb17d414649a71c0f29ea73e5bf_6/explore?location=43.084327%2C-89.409000%2C11.71) and [WI boundaries](https://data-wisdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5973013e60d34693b849af053918a5a3_0/explore?location=44.501257%2C-89.836800%2C7.44). Double-check that they're present in your repository.

#### Q32: Find all theaters located in Wisconsin (WI) and plot them on a map of WI.

#### Q33: Find the top 2 theaters nearest to the Peninsula State Park and plot them on a map of WI.
- Peninsula State Park coordinates: `(45.15602, -87.22109)` (latitute, longitude).
   - When specifying coordinates for query, list the longitude first and then latitude.

#### Q34: Find theaters within 10 miles of the UW-Madison and plot them on a map of Madison.
- UW-Madison coordinates: `(43.07540, -89.40816)` (latitute, longitude).
   - When specifying coordinates for query, list the longitude first and then latitude.


## :outbox_tray: Submission

- GitHub Classroom will automatically select your last pushed commit _before the deadline_ as your submission.
- **Technical issues within 36 hours of the deadline will not be considered as an excuse for late submission.**
- The structure of the required files for your submissions is as follows:
```
p3-<your_team_name>
|--- README.md (list names and e-mail IDs of team members at the top)
|--- p3.ipynb
|--- answers
     |--- q1.pkl
     .
     .
     .
     |--- q31.pkl
|--- q32.png
|--- q33.png
|--- q34.png
```
- It's OK to have the starter files (e.g. `sample_mflix.zip`, etc.) present too.

## :trophy: Testing
- GitHub Classroom has a simple autograder which will (auto-)execute each time you _push_ new commits. (You can also manually re-run it using the GitHub UI).
   - To view results (or re-run), go to `Actions` -> `<your_last_commit>` -> `run-autograding-tests`.
   - Re-run tab is at the top right, and you can view the results in the `Test` secton of `run-autograding-tests` (see image below).

:warning: It's good practice to frequently `commit` changes, but please try to `push` only when you _want_ to run the tests.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/example-autograder-output.png" alt="run-autograding-tests" width="450"/>
</p>

- Just because the autograder passes doesn't mean you'll get full points—we will still review your code manually.

### Point breakdown
